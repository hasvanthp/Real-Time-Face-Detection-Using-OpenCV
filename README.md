# Real-Time-Face-Detection-Using-OpenCV
A Python project leveraging OpenCV to perform real-time face detection using Haar cascades via webcam input.
# Real-Time Face Detection Using OpenCV

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple real-time face detection system using OpenCV and Haar Cascade Classifiers. The webcam captures live video, processes frames in grayscale, and highlights detected faces with bounding boxes.

## Features
- Uses OpenCV's pre-trained Haar cascade classifier
- Detects human faces in real time
- Displays video feed with live face detection
- Exits on pressing 'q'

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   
 How to Run
Run the script with:
python face_detection.py
Press 'q' to quit the live window.

ðŸ’¡ Features
Real-time webcam capture

Converts each frame to grayscale

Detects faces using Haar cascades

Draws green rectangles around detected faces

ðŸ“‚ Output
A webcam window showing faces highlighted in real-time.
